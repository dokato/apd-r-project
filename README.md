APD R project
=============

Collecting and visualization from APD (catalog of thesis) of University of Warsaw.

## Details
We webscraped from APD data of master and bachelor thesis defended on Faculty of Physics UW.
Than we created visualizations of the data. Interactive plots can be found in separete folders
and non-interactive in *plots* directory.
The work was an exercise just too train ourselves in dplyr, ggplot and scrapy packages.
